### For the Records:
“For the Records” is an interactive documentary on four young adults who live with the mental health issues Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Bi-polar Disorder, Eating Disorder (Anorexia Nervosa) and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

Whether you experience these issues yourself, know someone who does, or are simply curious, this website has been created to increase understanding of mental health disorders by providing a space for “shared experiences”, promote dialogue and alleviate stigma. It aims to achieve this goal by including interviews, short films, photo essays and experiential games that create a coherent whole, provide context to each other and illuminate complementary aspects of what it is like to live with mental health issues.

To ensure experiential accuracy, people with lived experience of the portrayed disorders have been strongly involved in the creative and production process, took leading roles on the game development teams, and participated in the films.

“For the Records” is an interdisciplinary effort bringing together DePaul’s cinema and game development program as well as the School of Nursing. All media pieces have been produced over the course of roughly one year (from summer 2013 to Spring 2014) with several film and game development student teams working in parallel under faculty supervision to make this project a reality.

### Perfection:
Playing with Perceptions of Beauty and Perfection

Perfection plays with perceptions of beauty and perfection to enable an experiential understanding of why someone would starve themselves. The game’s core metaphor is the body as garden. The game’s main premise is that a perfect garden is devoid of slugs and weeds. To achieve perfection, the player is asked to eliminate these unwanted elements until only the main plant in the middle is left.

The conflict of the game revolves around garden saturation (as indicated by a saturation meter in the bottom left corner of the screen). Watering the garden increases its saturation. The weeds flourish and the numbers of slugs rise. Eliminating slugs by moving the mouse over them in a scrubbing motion decreases saturation, as does parching the garden. Also, de-saturation is the only way to get rid of the weeds.
